A. GWAS Results [Can do this in stata on local machine]
1. Download a set of GWAS results. Results of interest are available from many of the major consortia such as SSGAC (http://www.thessgac.org/#!data/kuzq8) and the PGC (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/results-and-downloads). However, a major new resource from the Broad has a large resource of GWAS results (http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/). 
2. What information is in the file you downloaded? 
3. How many SNPs reach genome-wide significance? Does this match what they quote in the paper? If not, why not? 
4. Can you identify some of the top hits that they do discuss in the paper?
5. For these top hits, explore the regional maps (https://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldplot.php). How does the linkage structure compare across different populations? Would you expect these hits to be significant in a sample with different ancestry than the one used for discovery?
 
B. Polygenic Scores
6. Download the GIANT BMI results:
wget http://www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/images/1/15/SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq.gz
gunzip SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq.gz

Using those genome-wide significant hits from this GWAS that also happen to be in the HapMap database of SNPs, construct a top-hits genetic score using the plink --score option. 

awk '{if ($7<1e-5) print $0}' < SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq >top_hits.txt #bash, gets only hits less than 1e-5 for a top-hits score

#R
#get rid of ambig snps
read.table("top_hits.txt")->x
dim(x)
x[!(x[,2]=="A" & x[,3]=="T"),]->x
x[!(x[,2]=="T" & x[,3]=="A"),]->x
x[!(x[,2]=="C" & x[,3]=="G"),]->x
x[!(x[,2]=="G" & x[,3]=="C"),]->x
dim(x)
#so we're ok on ambig snps.
x[,c(1,2,5)]->x
write.table(x,file="top_hits_plink.txt",quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE) #necessary file for plink construction of scores

plink --bfile ceu_common --score top_hits_plink.txt --out bmi-1 #bash

#R
read.table("bmi-1.profile",header=TRUE)->x
plot(density(x[,6]))


The biggest problem with publicly available genetic data is that there are no phenotypes available. Take a look at a simple illustration of how one might examine the predictive robustness of the BMI PGS here:
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101596


7. How many of the SNPs are you able to use?  Have you looked at the .npred file? What is in there?
8. The PLOS One paper and our work have thus far used top-hits scores. If you look at some GWAS results, you'll see that these don't predict nearly as much out-of-sample variation as a genome-wide score where we use all available SNPs (e.g., http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3751588/figure/F2/). So, now let's construct a genome-wide score! This can be challenging, so we are going to use some code that I've previously assembled. 

plink --bfile common_le --keep ceu2.fam --make-bed --out ceu_common_le
awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $7, $5}' SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq > bmi-gwas.result #bash, get select columns of the gwas file: snp a1 a2 p effect

#R
library(HeritHelper) #see https://github.com/ben-domingue/HeritHelper
make_pgs(plink.file="~/wd/ceu_common_le",gwas.file="~/wd/bmi-gwas.result",out.name="~/wd/bmi-2",clump=FALSE,wd="/tmp/pgs-bmi/")


read.table("bmi-1.profile",header=TRUE)->x1
read.table("bmi-2.profile",header=TRUE)->x2
cor(x1[,6],x2[,6])


9. Compute a score in the Mex sample. What does its distribution look like? The Yoruban sample?
10. If you construct scores in the "other" Mexican sample, how do distributions differ by ancetry?
