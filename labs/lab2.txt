A. Allele Frequencies
1. For each of the hapmap groups we have data on, separately compute allele frequencies. How do they compare?
2. Still working with the separate groups, extract just the SNPs on chromosome 1. Compute LD within chromosome 1. How do the SNP associations compare across the gruops? 

B. Principal Components
3. Prune for LD within a single group.
4. With this pruned set of SNPs, compute principal components. 
5. Compare PCs across groups.
6. Replicate this based on a set of SNPs pruned for the other group. What differences do you note? 

C. Admixture
7. Use admixture in the joint sample ("common") to estimate the number of ancestral populations. Use only markers in LE. 

D. Look at Mexico data.
With CEU.YRI.MESTIZOS.NATIVO.550K.Common.1-22.v2.flipped data, try to recreate some of the results from 2009 PNAS paper (www.pnas.org͞cgi͞doi͞10.1073͞pnas.0903045106). Figure 2 would be a great target. You could also redo Figure 4 but using admixture instead of structure. Table S5 may also be interesting to compare to results from admixture.
